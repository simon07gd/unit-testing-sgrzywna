# Unit Testing: Practice Tasks

This repository contains practice tasks for the [Unit Testing](https://learning.griddynamics.com/#/online-courses/f70e294c-a3b0-4bab-a2ea-1a609ee347d8) course.

## Disclaimer

Do not use LLMs to get solutions for learning tasks. It is not prohibited, but it makes absolutely no sense. Although it can somehow help you in achieving goals in the short run, in the long run, your goal is to find a productive way of thinking inside yourself, and this is always the most important achievement in any course: to learn something and get better as a professional.

## How to work on these tasks

To finish the course, you will accomplish at least three mandatory tasks. Follow the next steps:

### 1. Create repository

Create a new **private** repository in the **gridu** organization using this repository as a template by pressing the button "Use this template":

![use template](./use-this-template.png)

![create repository](./create-repo.png)

### 2. Install dependencies

Clone your new repository and install all the dependencies in it:

```sh
npm ci
```

### 3. Accomplish tasks

After you read tasks and wrote tests, push them into the `main` branch, and don't forget to notify course professors and share access to your repo with them.

Mandatory tasks:

- [Task 1: Quantity Validator](./task1/README.md)
- [Task 2: Validation method with external request](./task2/README.md)
- [Task 3: Mocking dates](./task3/README.md)

Advanced tasks (optional but still recommended):

- [Task 4: Parametrized tests](./task4/README.md)
- [Task 5: Testing stateful modules](./task5/README.md)
- [Task 6: Stubbing api calls](./task6/README.md)
